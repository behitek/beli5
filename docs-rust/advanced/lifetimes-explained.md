## 🎯 What You'll Learn

Understanding Rust lifetimes through equipment lifecycle management - ensuring borrowed equipment is returned before the owner leaves.

---

## ⏳ Lifetime Basics

Lifetimes ensure that borrowed data remains valid for as long as we need it:

```rust
fn longest_equipment_name<'a>(name1: &'a str, name2: &'a str) -> &'a str {
    if name1.len() > name2.len() {
        name1
    } else {
        name2
    }
}

fn main() {
    let helmet = "Professional Safety Helmet";
    let vest = "High-Visibility Vest";
    
    let longest = longest_equipment_name(helmet, vest);
    println!("Longest name: {}", longest);
}
```

This advanced topic covers lifetime annotations, lifetime elision rules, and complex lifetime scenarios in structs and implementations.
