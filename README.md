## 🦀 Why Rust Instead of HTML?

We replaced HTML with **Rust** because:

### 🛡️ **Safety First Approach**
- Rust teaches memory safety from the beginning
- Perfect for learning good programming habits
- Prevents common programming mistakes automatically

### ⚡ **Performance & Modern Development**
- Rust is used by major tech companies (Discord, Dropbox, Firefox)
- Growing rapidly in popularity
- Excellent for both beginners and advanced projects

### 🎯 **Unique Learning Experience**
- Different from typical beginner languages
- Teaches system-level concepts in a safe way
- Builds confidence through compiler guidance

### 🌟 **Career Relevance**
- High demand in the job market
- Used for web backends, system programming, and blockchain
- Excellent foundation for understanding computer science concepts
