## 🔒 Advanced Borrowing Rules

Think of borrowing like **professional safety equipment checkout protocols** with strict rules to prevent accidents:

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut equipment = String::from("Safety Equipment Set");
    
    // Multiple immutable borrows are allowed
    let inspector1 = &equipment;
    let inspector2 = &equipment;
    println!("Inspector 1 sees: {}", inspector1);
    println!("Inspector 2 sees: {}", inspector2);
    
    // But only one mutable borrow at a time
    let maintenance = &mut equipment;
    maintenance.push_str(" - Inspected");
    println!("After maintenance: {}", maintenance);
}
```

This advanced topic covers complex scenarios like interior mutability, reference counting, and lifetime elision that professional Rust developers encounter daily.
