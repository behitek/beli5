## 🎯 What You'll Learn

Creating flexible, reusable code with traits (shared behavior) and generics (type flexibility) - like universal safety standards that work for any equipment.

---

## 🏷️ Traits: Shared Behavior

Define common safety behaviors that different equipment types can implement:

```rust
trait SafetyInspectable {
    fn inspect(&self) -> bool;
    fn safety_rating(&self) -> u8;
    
    fn is_safe(&self) -> bool {
        self.safety_rating() >= 7 && self.inspect()
    }
}

struct Helmet {
    name: String,
    rating: u8,
}

impl SafetyInspectable for Helmet {
    fn inspect(&self) -> bool {
        println!("Inspecting helmet: {}", self.name);
        true
    }
    
    fn safety_rating(&self) -> u8 {
        self.rating
    }
}
```

This advanced topic covers trait objects, associated types, advanced generic constraints, and zero-cost abstractions.
