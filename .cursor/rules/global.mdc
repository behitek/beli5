## 📋 Content Strategy Framework

### 1. **ELI5 (Explain Like I'm 5) Methodology**

#### Core Principles:
- **Simplicity First**: Break complex concepts into digestible pieces
- **Analogy-Driven**: Use familiar objects and activities for explanations
- **Encouraging Tone**: Maintain positive, supportive language throughout
- **Error-Friendly**: Normalize mistakes as part of the learning process
- **Visual Learning**: Incorporate emojis, colors, and visual hierarchy

#### Language Guidelines:
- **Primary Language**: All content written in Vietnamese (Tiếng Việt)
- Avoid technical jargon without explanation (explain in Vietnamese)
- Use conversational, friendly tone in Vietnamese
- Include reassuring phrases like "Đừng lo, điều này dễ hơn bạn nghĩ!"
- Provide multiple ways to understand the same concept in Vietnamese
- Always relate to Vietnamese culture and real-world experiences
- Use familiar Vietnamese analogies and examples

### 2. **Progressive Difficulty System**

#### 🟢 **Super Easy Basics** (Green Level)
- **Audience**: Complete beginners, young children
- **Approach**: Single concept per lesson, lots of encouragement
- **Examples**: What is programming? Variables as boxes
- **Success Metrics**: Can explain concept to a friend

#### 🟡 **Getting Warmer** (Yellow Level)  
- **Audience**: Learners with basic understanding
- **Approach**: Combining concepts, practical examples
- **Examples**: If/then logic, simple loops
- **Success Metrics**: Can write basic programs

#### 🔴 **Challenge Time** (Red Level)
- **Audience**: Confident beginners ready for complexity
- **Approach**: Real-world applications, problem-solving
- **Examples**: Functions, classes, file handling
- **Success Metrics**: Can build complete projects

## 📝 ELI5 Blog Sharing Strategy

### 1. **Content Sharing Guidelines**

#### Transparency Requirements:
- Global announcement bar displays ELI5 blog sharing approach site-wide
- Content is shared with educational purpose for Vietnamese learners
- Maintain transparency about ELI5 methodology and learning objectives
- Include community contribution opportunities

#### Quality Assurance:
- All code examples must be tested and functional
- Analogies must be age-appropriate and culturally sensitive for Vietnamese audience
- Content must be factually accurate and educationally sound
- Regular review and updates based on community feedback

### 2. **Content Sharing Workflow**

```
1. Concept Identification → 
2. Vietnamese Analogy Selection → 
3. ELI5 Content Creation → 
4. Community Review and Refinement.
```

#### Content Templates:
- **Introduction Pages**: Mission, Vietnamese analogies, encouragement
- **Concept Pages**: Definition, Vietnamese analogies, examples, practice
- **Project Pages**: Step-by-step builds, explanations, extensions
- **Help Pages**: Troubleshooting, getting assistance, resources

### 3. **User Experience Design**

#### Navigation Strategy:
- **Horizontal Navigation**: Top menu for language switching
- **Vertical Navigation**: Sidebar for topic progression
- **Breadcrumbs**: Clear path indication
- **Search**: Future integration with Algolia or local search

#### Visual Design:
- **Kid-Friendly Colors**: Bright, engaging palette
- **Playful Elements**: Animations, hover effects, emojis
- **Responsive Design**: Works on all devices
- **Dark Mode**: Eye comfort for extended learning
- **Mermaid Diagrams**: Interactive flowcharts and diagrams for visual learning

#### Mermaid Integration Strategy:
Docusaurus supports Mermaid diagrams natively, enabling visual representations of:
- **Programming Flow**: Conditional logic, loops, and decision trees
- **Data Structures**: Arrays, objects, and relationships
- **System Architecture**: How different parts of programs connect
- **Learning Paths**: Visual progression through topics
- **Problem-Solving**: Step-by-step algorithmic thinking

Example Mermaid usage:
```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[Start Learning] --> B{Choose Language};
    B --> C[🐍 Python];
    B --> D[☕ Java];
    B --> E[⚡ C++];
    B --> F[🦀 Rust];
    C --> G[Basic Concepts];
    D --> G;
    E --> G;
    F --> G;
    G --> H[Practice Projects];
    H --> I[Advanced Topics];
```
