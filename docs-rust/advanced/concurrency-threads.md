# âš¡ Concurrency and Threads: Parallel Safety Operations

ðŸ¤– **AI-Generated Content**: This page was created by AI to help explain Rust programming concepts in simple terms. While we've checked it carefully, always ask an adult or teacher if something doesn't make sense!

## ðŸŽ¯ What You'll Learn

Safe concurrent programming with threads, channels, and async operations - like coordinating multiple safety inspectors working simultaneously.

---

## ðŸ§µ Thread Safety

Rust's ownership system prevents data races at compile time:

```rust
use std::thread;
use std::sync::Arc;
use std::sync::Mutex;

fn main() {
    let equipment_counter = Arc::new(Mutex::new(0));
    let mut handles = vec![];
    
    for i in 0..10 {
        let counter = Arc::clone(&equipment_counter);
        let handle = thread::spawn(move || {
            let mut num = counter.lock().unwrap();
            *num += 1;
            println!("Inspector {} completed inspection", i);
        });
        handles.push(handle);
    }
    
    for handle in handles {
        handle.join().unwrap();
    }
    
    println!("Total inspections: {}", *equipment_counter.lock().unwrap());
}
```

This advanced topic covers thread spawning, message passing, shared state, async/await, and fearless concurrency patterns.
