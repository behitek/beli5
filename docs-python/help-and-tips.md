- "Why won't my program run?"
- "Can you help me understand what a variable is?"
- "I don't understand this instruction - can you explain it differently?"

### üü° Medium Problems (Ask Someone Who Knows Computers)
- "My Python code has a bug I can't find"
- "How do I install Python on our computer?"
- "This loop isn't working the way I expected"
- "Can you help me understand how functions work?"

### üî¥ Hard Problems (Ask a Python Expert)
- "I want to make a game but don't know where to start"
- "How do I connect my Python program to the internet?"
- "I'm getting complex error messages I don't understand"
- "Can you help me plan a big Python project?"

## What to Tell Adults About Python üó£Ô∏è

### If They Don't Know Programming:
"Python is a programming language that's really good for beginners. It's like teaching a computer to do things using almost-English instructions. I'm learning it because it can make games, websites, and solve math problems!"

### Show Them This Simple Example:
```python
# This is Python code - see how it's almost like English?
name = "Alex"
age = 10
print("Hi! My name is", name, "and I am", age, "years old!")

# When you run this, it says: Hi! My name is Alex and I am 10 years old!
```

## Common Python Problems and Solutions üîß

### Problem: "SyntaxError" Messages
**What it means**: You wrote something Python doesn't understand  
**Ask adult to check**: Missing quotes, parentheses, or colons  
**Example**: `print("Hello"` should be `print("Hello")`

### Problem: "NameError" Messages  
**What it means**: You used a variable name Python doesn't recognize  
**Ask adult to check**: Spelling of variable names  
**Example**: `print(nam)` should be `print(name)`

### Problem: "IndentationError" Messages
**What it means**: Your spacing/tabs are wrong  
**Ask adult to check**: Lines should line up properly  
**Example**: Code inside `if` statements needs to be indented

### Problem: Program Runs But Does Wrong Thing
**What it means**: Logic error (bug) in your thinking  
**Ask adult to help**: Walk through your code step by step  
**Example**: Using `+` when you meant `-` in a calculation

## Questions Adults Might Ask You ü§ì

**Be ready to answer:**

1. **"What version of Python are you using?"**
   - Look for "Python 3.x" (like Python 3.9 or Python 3.11)

2. **"What program are you using to write Python?"**
   - Common answers: IDLE, VS Code, PyCharm, Replit
   - Show them the program on your screen

3. **"What were you trying to make your program do?"**
   - Explain in simple terms: "I wanted it to add two numbers"
   - Show them the tutorial you were following
